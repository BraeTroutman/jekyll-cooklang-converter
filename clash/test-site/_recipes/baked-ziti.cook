set a #pot of water on the stove, to boil (you'll need for pasta later), and preheat the oven to 350

cut @mushrooms{1/2%box} into slices, and sautee (no oil) in a pan over medium high heat until browned. Set aside

brown @ground sausage{1%pound} in the same pan, seasoning with @garlic powder{}, @italian seasoning{}, and @chili powder{} set aside

the water should hopefully be boiling by now-- add @dry ziti{1%pound} and leave to cook according to package instructions (usually around 10 minutes)

chop and sautee @large yellow onion{1} in @olive oil{}. Seasoning with @salt{}. Add the @bell pepper{1}, chopped

add back in the mushrooms and sausage, and pour @pasta sauce{1%jar} over everything. Mix well, and allow it to simmer until it bubbles a bit at the bottom

mix together @ricotta{1%15oz package} and @shredded mozarella{1%cup}

layer half of the cooked pasta into the bottom of a greased #casserole dish{}. Ladle half of the meat + veggie mixture on top. Then, spread the cheese mixture from the previous step on top of everything. Layer @sliced provolone{1%package} on that, followed by the rest of the sauce, the rest of the pasta, and a final layer of @mozarella cheese{2%cups}. Sprinkle the top with italian seasoning

put the dish in the preheated oven for ~{25%minutes}. Then it's all ready!
